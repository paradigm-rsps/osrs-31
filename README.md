#OSRS Classic: Rev 31  
  
This is a refactor for OSRS revision 31.  
Which means this codebase is rumored to have been released on 28 November 2013.   

Notable features of a client from this era:  
```
No Grand Exchange - Trade with players as god intended.
No zeah
No Raids
No Rooftop Agility
No Ironman
No resizeable
```  
  
It is a significant leap in terms of what players are used to,  
and would honestly bring the game back into line with what was originally promised.
